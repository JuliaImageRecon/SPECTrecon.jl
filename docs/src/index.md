# Documentation for [SPECTrecon](https://github.com/JeffFessler/SPECTrecon.jl)

## Overview

This Julia module provides
SPECT forward and back projectors
for parallel-beam collimators.
Designed for use with the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox
[(MIRT)](https://github.com/JeffFessler/MIRT.jl)
and similar frameworks.

The method implemented here is based on the 1992 paper
by GL Zeng & GT Gullberg
"Frequency domain implementation
of the three-dimensional geometric point response correction in SPECT imaging"
[(DOI)](http://doi.org/10.1109/23.173222).

See the
[Examples](@ref 1-overview)
tab to the left for usage details.
